# Vector-tests-with-sorting-algorithms

- Abstract

This work aims to experiment and compare the Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort algorithms. The tests consisted of obtaining data on the algorithms' execution time as a function of n, where n is the total size of the vector. We chose to use an integer-type vector to obtain data that facilitates subsequent analysis and understanding.
